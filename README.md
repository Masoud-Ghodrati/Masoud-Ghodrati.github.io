## Welcome to my page

I am a data scientist with expertise in machine learning, data analysis, statistics, computer vision, and computational modelling. During my academic career, I completed degrees in Electronics Engineering (B.Eng. 2009), Biomedical Engineering (M.Eng. Bio-electric 2012), and Computational Neuroscience (PhD 2018). I worked on different research and industry projects ranging from computational and visual neuroscience, object recognition in humans (visual psychophysics, EEG), animals (behaviour and electrophysiology), and machines (DNNs and CNNs) to image segmentation (e.g., architectural floor plans and maps segmentation),  sales forecast, and AI-based clinical diagnosis (e.g., hearing disorders diagnosis).
